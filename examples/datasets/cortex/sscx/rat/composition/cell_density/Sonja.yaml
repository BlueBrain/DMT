# We have to decide the format of the datasets used for validations.
# Current CircuitValidations assume a YAML, which I am porting the existing
# datasets to, from Python classes in the legacy ValidationFramework.

what: >-
  number of neurons for a given volume (40x648.35xlayer thickness [um3])
  of each cortical layer

  spreadsheet also contains layer thicknesses -
  no online version of the data for now (to be added)

# means were derived from cell counts and layer thickness estimates

  - 69.1
  - 93.6

# for the std, we assumed a 5% variation in layer thickness and slice width
# as well as a std of sqrt(cell count) for the cell count
# these different stds were combined using the rules and
# usual formulas of error propagation
# http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty
# CAVEAT: this accounts only for error due to measurement,
# not intrinsic variability of the data set
