A chart illustrating connection strengths in a network.
Source nodes are placed along a vertical line on the left,
and target nodes along a vertical line on the right.
Flows are used to connect sources to targets.
Size of a source node is proportional to it's total out-degree,
while the size of a target node is proportional to it's in-degree.
