"""According to ZOPE:
An interface specifies the external behavior of objects that 'provide' them,
through

1. Informal documentation in a doc string
2. Attribute definitions
3. Invariants, conditions that must hold for objects that provide the interface

An object's interface specifies the object's
1. characteristics
2. behavior
3. capabilities
The interface describes what an object can do, to learn how, you must look at
the implementation.
