Cortical area such as the \model{brain_region} is composed
of layers of cells with different cell densities.
In this report we analyze circuit composition
of cortical layers \model{layer_values},
focusing on total cell density and the fraction
of inhibitory neurons in each layer.
In our model of the \model{brain_region}
we have reconstructed the sub-regions \model{sub_brain_regions}.
Experimental measurements for cell densities
for these sub-regions were not available.
Hence we have used the same cell densities presented
in the figure for each of the these regions.
