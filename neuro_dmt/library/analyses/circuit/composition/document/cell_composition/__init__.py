        Cell densities are an essential input to building a realistic
        brain-region circuit. Cell density varies widely across the cortex.
        Layer boundaries are determined experimentally by locating transitions
        in cell densities and soma-sizes. Accordingly, a reconstruction of
        a brain region should have the same cell densities in its various sub-regions
        as that observed experimentally, and reproduce the input values.


        Individual neurons show a lot of morphological and electro-physiological
        diversity. A brain reconstruction must also reproduce experimentally
        observed neuronal diversity across the modeled regions. In this report
        we analyze cell densities  and cell type diversity across the modeled
        brain regions:
